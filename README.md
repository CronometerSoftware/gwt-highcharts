# gwt-highcharts
GWT Highcharts is a freely available open source library that provides an elegant and feature complete approach for including Highcharts and Highstock visualizations within a GWT application using pure Java code.

Detailed documentation, demonstration of the different chart types, and source examples can be found on the [project home page](https://www.moxiegroup.com/moxieapps/gwt-highcharts/).

Note that this GitHub repository is the new home GWT Highcharts going forward, and it therefore effectively replaces the SourceForge project with the same name.
